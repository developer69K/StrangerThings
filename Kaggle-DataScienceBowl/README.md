## Domain Background
  - Create a Nuclei Detector to detect disease and speed drug recovery
  - Can a deep learning model be used to distinguish what a nuclei looks like regardless of the type of stain used
  - Nuclei are the most distinguishable part of the cell
  - One model that finds out Nuclei across different systems , and experimental systems and data
  - There are 25000 nuclei images for this challenge that was present for the competition
